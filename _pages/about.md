Welcome!
The research team focuses on the challenging problems and works in the field of photoelectric detection and imaging.
We are mainly engaged in the controlled preparation, luminescence regulation, mechanism exploration and application research in the fields of imaging, display, laser, sensing, detection and energy, including:
1. Stimulus-responsive micro/nano-materials for sensing, display, and imaging;
2. Rare earth doped micro/nano-materials;
3. Low-dimensional halide perovskite materials.
